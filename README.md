# Restaurant-Recommended-System
This project entails the development of a restaurant recommendation system utilizing a content-based approach. The system recommends restaurants based on user preferences, including factors 
such as restaurant name, location, and type. By employing content-based recommendation techniques, the system analyzes the characteristics of restaurants and suggests options that align with 
the user's specified criteria. Users can receive personalized recommendations tailored to their preferences, enhancing their dining experiences. 
The system aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly solution for discovering restaurants that match individual tastes and requirements.
